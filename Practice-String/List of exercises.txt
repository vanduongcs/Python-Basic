I. Basic String Exercises
    1/ String Length
        Write a Python program that asks the user to input a string and prints its length using the len() function.

    2/ String Concatenation
        Write a Python program that takes two strings as input and concatenates them.

    3/ String Slicing
        Write a Python program that takes a string and two indices, and prints the substring between those indices.

    4/ String Reversal
        Write a program to reverse a string provided by the user.

    5/ Check Substring
        Write a Python program to check if a given substring exists within a string.

II. Intermediate String Exercises
    6/ String Uppercase and Lowercase
        Ask the user for a string and print the string in all uppercase and all lowercase.

    7/ Count Occurrences
        Write a Python program to count the number of times a specific character appears in a string.

    8/ String Replacement
        Write a program that replaces all occurrences of a particular substring in a given string with another substring.

    9/ Palindrome Check
        Write a Python program to check if a string is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward).

    10/ Find Index of a Substring
        Ask the user for a string and a substring, then find the index of the first occurrence of that substring.

III. Advanced String Exercises
    11/ Remove Whitespace
        Write a program that removes leading and trailing spaces from a string and replaces multiple spaces within the string with a single space.

    12/ Anagram Check
        Write a Python program to check if two input strings are anagrams of each other (i.e., both strings contain the same characters but in different orders).

    13/ Capitalize Each Word
        Write a program to capitalize the first letter of each word in a string.

    14/ Longest Word in a Sentence
        Write a Python program that takes a sentence and finds the longest word in it.

    15/ Remove Vowels
        Write a program that removes all vowels from a string.

    16/ Count Words
        Write a program that counts the number of words in a string.

    17/ String Compression
        Write a Python program to compress a string by counting consecutive occurrences of characters (e.g., "aaabbc" becomes "a3b2c").

    18/ Password Strength Checker
        Write a Python program that checks the strength of a password based on length, presence of digits, uppercase, lowercase, and special characters.
